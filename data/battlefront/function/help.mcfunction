tellraw @s {"text":"Thanks for testing my Battlefront datapack.\n\nNote that this pack is in development, so features will differ on release (if it ever occurs).\n\nPlaying multiplayer is required as of now, there is no PvE, however you may still test aspects in singleplayer.\n\nYou may set command posts with the command \"/function battlefront:spawnpost/post<letter-from-a-to-e>\".\n\nTo set team spawn points, run the command \"/function battlefront:setteamspawn/<teamname>\".\n\nYou'll also want to set a death viewing area with \"/function battlefront:setdeathspectatearea\", which is the location people will be teleported to constantly on death, and \"/function battlefront:setfacingspectatearea\", which is the location people will face constantly when dead.\n\nTo change the respawn time on death, simply run /scoreboard players set @a respawnTime <time>. Note that the time is in ticks (1/20ths of a second) and not in seconds.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you need further help.\n\n-Cuno","color":"aqua"}
